Income Data Clustering using K-Means
Project Overview

This project applies the K-Means clustering algorithm to group records in the income_full dataset based on income-related numerical features. The objective is to discover natural patterns in the data using unsupervised machine learning.

Problem Statement

The goal of this project is to segment income data into meaningful clusters without predefined labels, enabling better understanding of income distribution and data structure.

Dataset

The project uses the income_full dataset, which contains numerical attributes related to income.
These features are used to form clusters through distance-based learning.

Methodology

Loaded and explored the dataset

Selected relevant numerical income features

Applied the K-Means clustering algorithm

Determined the optimal number of clusters

Visualized the clustered groups for interpretation

Machine Learning Technique

K-Means clustering (unsupervised learning).

Results

The model successfully separated the income data into distinct clusters based on similarity in feature values, allowing clear visualization of income-based group patterns.
